## Methodology

For analyzing the experiences and perceptions of women in Romania regarding cervical cancer screening and follow-up care, we will use a thematic analysis approach. This methodology is suitable for identifying, analyzing, and reporting patterns (themes) within the data, which allows us to provide a rich, detailed, and nuanced account of the data.

The thematic analysis process will involve the following steps:

1. **Familiarization with the Data**:
   - Reviewing the interviews to understand the content and context of the responses.
   - Identifying key variables and potential themes.

2. **Generating Initial Codes**:
    - Coding the data to identify interesting features or patterns.
    - Creating initial codes based on the content of the responses.

3. **Searching for Themes**:
    - Collating codes into potential themes.
    - Reviewing and refining themes to ensure they accurately represent the data.

4. **Defining, naming, reviewing Themes**:
    - Checking the themes against the coded extracts and the entire dataset.
    - Ensuring the themes work in relation to the coded extracts and the dataset as a whole.

   - **Limited Awareness:** Many participants had limited awareness of cervical cancer and the availability of preventive tests like the HPV test. For example, Participant 2 mentioned not knowing about preventive tests until being informed by a doctor.
   - **Sources of Information:** Information was primarily obtained from healthcare professionals rather than media or public health campaigns.

2. **Barriers to Accessing Healthcare**
   - **Financial Constraints:** Several participants reported financial barriers to accessing necessary healthcare services, including diagnostic tests and treatments.
   - **Healthcare Accessibility:** Geographic and logistical barriers were also significant, with some participants noting difficulties in accessing specialist care and diagnostic facilities.

3. **Emotional Reactions to Test Results**
   - **Anxiety and Fear:** Receiving a positive result for HPV or abnormal Pap smear results induced significant anxiety and fear among participants. For instance, Participant 6 described crying all day after receiving a positive HPV test result.
   - **Need for Emotional Support:** The need for better emotional support and clear communication from healthcare providers was highlighted, as participants often felt isolated and scared after receiving their results.
